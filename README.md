ConvexHull2D
============

A weekend project to implement various algorithms for finding the convex hull of a set of 2D points using C++ and the Standard Library where possible.

Included are Graham's scan, the gift-wrapping algorithm, the monotone-chain algorithm, and QuickHull.

For clarity, the code makes no effort to account for duplicate or collinear points.
